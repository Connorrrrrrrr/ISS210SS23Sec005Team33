                            <h5>Our group chose to investigate the unique struggles that migrants and asylum seekers at the Southern border of the U.S. face due to current American border policy. We believe that this issue matters because these policies cause many preventable instances of death, violence, and lasting trauma to people already trying to escape very difficult situations in their home countries. </h5>

                            Title 42 is a policy that was enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic and is still in effect today. The stated purpose of enacting it was to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into the US. However, the CDC now states that the policy is no longer needed to protect public health. The policy allows the U.S. to expel asylum seekers to Mexico or to their home countries where they must wait for long periods of time for their cases to proceed, if they ever do proceed. Critics say that this policy violates international law that states that people have the right to apply for asylum in the country they are fleeing to for safety. Requiring asylum seekers to remain in Mexico often puts them in danger of extortion, violence, and kidnapping at the hands of gangs and cartels (“A Guide to Title 42 Expulsions at the Border”). Additionally, the deterrents in place to keep migrants from entering the country such as border walls have been shown to greatly increase deaths. People can become severely injured or die after falling from border walls, or they may traverse long and dangerous terrain with few supplies to evade the walls (Rosenberg). Furthermore, the shelters that many of these migrants wait at for months are often overcrowded and unsafe. The following video by Human Rights Watch describes some of the hardships and dangers that many asylum seekers waiting in Mexico experience, with a firsthand account from a migrant from Venezuela. </p>
