                        <p>When covid hit in the United States, many people did not what to do and there became a thing of safety to keep distance. While all that was happening because of covid migrants were having a very hard time getting past the southern boarders of Mexico. An article by Rice University Baker Insititute For Public Policy writes “ Deportations thus continued, with nearly 21,000 expulsions carried out in March and April 2020 alone.10 Meanwhile, asylum seekers were left waiting indefinitely at camps and shelters along the border for an immigration court hearing, becoming more vulnerable to the virus in the crowded and squalid living conditions” (Immobile and Vulnerable: Migrants at Mexico’s Southern Border at the Outset of Covid-19 | Baker Institute, n.d.).  Covid at the time was causing people to get very sick and many leading to death or hospitalization, which immigrants and migrants and those looking for asylum camps.  </p>
                        <p>While Mexico did not close it boarders, there was some problems with other central American counties. One of them being Guatemala. Rice University writes,” March 20, 2020, Mexico’s government agreed to receive Central Americans deported from the U.S. and to send them south through Mexico. However, this raised issues at the Guatemala border: Mexico bussed the migrants to Tabasco and Chiapas, but Guatemala had closed its border” (Immobile and Vulnerable: Migrants at Mexico’s Southern Border at the Outset of Covid-19 | Baker Institute, n.d.).  Causing there to be more problems for those trying to get through to southern Mexico. The ones that did make it to southern Mexico then dealt with those in Mexico who did not want to possibly get Covid make getting a place in southern Mexico very hard,” some communities did implement local lockdown measures. Fearing the possibility of infection from the outside, these communities put up checkpoints preventing the entry of unauthorized migrants” (Immobile and Vulnerable: Migrants at Mexico’s Southern Border at the Outset of Covid-19 | Baker Institute, n.d.). There is still a need for help at the southern board of Mexico and all over Centeral and South America.  </p>
